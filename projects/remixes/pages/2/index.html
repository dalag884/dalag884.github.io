    If by Rudyard Kipling

<p>
   <font size="10">  If </font> you can keep your head when all about you <br>
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
   <font size="9">  If </font> you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
        But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
    <font size="8"> If </font> you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
        <br>
   <font size="7">  If </font> you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
       <font size="6">  If </font> you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    <font size="5">  If </font> you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
        And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
    <font size="4">  If </font> you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
        And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br>
<br>
    <font size="5">  If </font> you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
        And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
    <font size="4">  If </font> you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
        To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
        Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br>
<br>
   <font size="3">  If </font> you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
        Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
    <font size="2">  If </font> neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
        <font size="1">  If </font> all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
    <font size="0.5">  If </font> you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
        With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
        And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!<br>
